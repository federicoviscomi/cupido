* Add a timer in the GUI (and maybe also in the backend) to prevent an user
  from waiting endlessly instead of dealing a card.
* Add to the local (and maybe also the global) chat some notifications to
  let others know when a user joins the chat or leaves it.
* Keep the local chat usable even at the end of the game, before the users
  exit.
